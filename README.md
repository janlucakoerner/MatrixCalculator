### Short introduction:

My final project for the cs50x course delivers a calculator for matrices and vectors.

### Possible Operations:

Possible arithmetic operations of the matrix and vector calculator are:
* Matrix addition,
* Matrix subtraction,
* Matrix multiplication,
* Matrix inversion,
* Matrix inverse multiplication,
* Matrix potency,
* Matrix determinant,
* Vector addition,
* Vector subtraction and
* Vector scalar multiplication.

These arithmetic operations are possible for every matrix dimension,
except if the arithmetic operation calculates at the datatype bounds of a `java.math.BigDecimal`.

### How the Matrix Calculator works:

1. At the start of the java program you will see a frame with many buttons,
   where you can select your desired arithmetic operation.
2. By pressing the load from csv button, you have the opportunity to select a csv file which is separated by semicolon
and which contains a matrix. The selected csv file will automatically be loaded in the inline field next to the button.
3. Another opportunity is to press the open edit matrix button. Then you can insert a new matrix or edit a csv loaded matrix.
4. If the inline field next to the open matrix button does not contain data, you will also have the opportunity to
insert a custom matrix with the transferred row and column count. Therefor you only have to press the open edit matrix button.

### Used Technologies:

* `maven` as build tool for the java program.
* `java` as programming language for all arithmetic operations.
* `java.swing` as graphical user interface extension for Java.
* `java.math.BigDecimal` as datatype for each represented value.

### Fraction Datatype:

For higher precision this software defines a new datatype named `Fraction` which provides coverage of the rational numbers.

### Sourcecode structure
The sourcecode of the software is completely written in Java. Beside the main class there are three packages named `backend`,
`middleware` and `frontend`. The `backend` package provides parser functions to read matrices from csv files or inline fields.
The `middleware` package provides all arithmetic operations on one side for `BigDecimal` datatype and on the other side for
`Fraction` datatype. This package is divided in another package named `base`, which contains the implementation of the
`Fraction` datatype and all interfaces which are necessary for the `Fraction` datatype. The last package is the `frontend`
package. In this package there are several gui classes for every arithmetic operation. In the `frontend` package there is
also a package named `base` located, which provides the different operation types and a number as well as a matrices panel.
