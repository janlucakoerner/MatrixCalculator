# MatrixCalculator

My final project for the cs50x course delivers a calculator for matrices and vectors.

### Possible Operations:
Possible arithmetic operations of the matrix and vector calculator are:
* Matrix addition,
* Matrix subtraction,
* Matrix multiplication,
* Matrix inversion,
* Matrix inverse multiplication,
* Matrix potency,
* Solve of linear system of equations,
* Vector addition,
* Vector subtraction and
* Vector scalar multiplication.

These arithmetic operations are possible for every matrix dimension,
except if the arithmetic operation calculates at the datatype bounds of a `java.math.BigDecimal`.

### How the Matrix Calculator works:
1. At the start of the java program you will see a frame with many button,
   where you can select your desired arithmetic operation.
2. 

### Used Technologies:
* `Java` as programming language for all arithmetic operations.
* `java.swing` as graphical user interface extension for Java.
* `java.math.BigDecimal` as datatype for each represented value.
